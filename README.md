[PLAY IT HERE!](http://louroboros-1gam201304.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

A short puzzle game made for [Ludum Dare 26](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&uid=12236).

### source code

I used my own engine to make the game, but I plan on selling it, so I can't really release the source publicly.

If you're interested, [email me!](mailto:louis.acresti@gmail.com) I'm looking for alpha/beta testers.
